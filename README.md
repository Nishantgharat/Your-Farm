# Your-Farm

* In our country farmers are exploited the most even though the government has introduced many schemes to protect them. 

* There are close to a whopping 126 million smallholder and marginal farmers in India. The only way we could help them all is to begin by helping our local farmers. 

* We found out that there is an absence of a platform for our local farmers to sell their produce directly to the customer.

* YourFarm is an e-farm application that not only brings the customers closer to the farmers in their trade but moreover makes the customers an advocate for the farmers. 

* This is made possible by our application as it does more than just trade. It makes the consumer aware of the dilemma farmers are going through.
